# Hytera-Repeater-Bridge-FoxPro !!! STATUS: UNFINISHED (See ToDo.txt)
Programming in Visual Fox Pro v6 &amp; v9 (Yes, quite old) Interfacing a PC with a Hytera RD985 Repeater over UDP using Hytera-Defined-Mode Protocol.

Hi, My name is Rob, Let me start by saying I'm not an expert at any of this.

But I am quite good with communications & technology.
And the reason I program in such an old language is because I have 18 years of experiance with Microsoft Visual FoxPro, And I find it difficult to learn new languages that keep changing with almost no backwards compatability. (BTW thats my opinion and I'm not smearing those other languages, It's something that "I" struggle with)

As for my code, I claim no interlectual rights on this so you may learn,copy and change anything you like.
As for the reverse engineering of the Hytera-Defined-Mode protocol, This was done using some sources on Git-Hub and some real simple google searches.
Also I did apply to Hytera for notes on the API that requires me signing an NDA, However they ignored me so I have not signed any NDA.
Protocol discovery can be very complicated (Did I mention the lack of API notes) so allot of this is based from experiments I have performed on my own equipment, However this does mean I may have got some things wrong.

If you have ideas or code suggestions for me please use the usual methord on GitHub.

And if you are still reading this, thank you for your interest.
