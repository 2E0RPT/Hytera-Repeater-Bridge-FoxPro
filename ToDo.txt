DONE:
1) Connect to repeater TMP(Text-Message_Protocol) & stay connected with keepalive packets.
2) Decipher bytes sent from repeater when a message is sent from a DMR radio.
3) Decipher bytes to be sent to repeater when a message is sent from the PC.
4) Encode & Decode the 24bit's used for Dest_ID & Source_ID.
5) Implement auto reply routines outside of the form (Eg: /ping & /time).
6) Decipher $GNRMC GPS Data bytes from Baofeng DMX's DMR-APRS message.
7) Encode UI standard APRS position reports from Baofeng standard position reports. 
8) Simple system to convert Radio_ID's into freindly names.

UNFINISHED:
9) Detect when repeater communication is lost so we can try re-establish the connection.
10) Make a network connection to the APRS network (or UI compatible server).

WORKING ON SOON:
Bridge between APRS messages and DMR SMS Messages.
